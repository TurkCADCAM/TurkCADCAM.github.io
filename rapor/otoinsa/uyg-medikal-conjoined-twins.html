      <P><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>August 15, 2002</b> -- Maria Teresa and Maria de Jesus Quiej-Alvarez were born on 
        July 24, 2001 in a rural village in Guatemala. Together, they weighed 4.4 pounds 
        at birth and, despite their small size, were healthy in every way -- except for 
        being joined at the head. Over the past year, the girls have remained healthy 
        and happy but they have been severely restricted by their condition. Recently, a 
        nonprofit organization called <B>Healing the Children</B> (<A 
href="http://www.healingthechildren.org">www.healingthechildren.org</A>) 
        arranged for the girls to be flown to Los Angeles where a volunteer team of 
        neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons at the <B>University of California Los 
          Angeles (UCLA) Mattel Childrens&#8217; Hospital</B> successfully separated them in a 
        22-hour-long operation. Today, both girls are doing well, and the prognosis for 
        both is excellent. Without rapid prototyping, say the doctors, the operation 
        would have been much more difficult.</font></P>

      <P><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For some years, rapid prototyping has found limited acceptance in the medical 
        world, but most doctors, skilled at reading x-rays, magnetic imaging data, and 
        computed tomography scans, don&#8217;t know about the technology. Those who do often 
        feel that rapid prototyping delivers no more information than other methods.</font></P>
      <P 
style="mso-list: none; mso-list-ins: 'L. Stephen  Wolfe' 20020814T1423"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 
        a small number of surgeons, particularly those doing complex facial 
        reconstructions, have found that building rapid prototyping models of underlying 
        bones and using them to plan procedures can shave hours off the time required 
        for actual operations. In some cases, use of biomodels can eliminate the need 
        for exploratory operations altogether.</font></P>
      <P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN

      <P><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For a physician, separating conjoined twins is one of the most complicated 
        procedures imaginable. Intertwining bones, nerves, blood vessels, and other 
        tissues force doctors planning such operations to abandon everything they know 
        of normal anatomy and chart from scratch the way each of these unique pairs is 
        arranged. In the case of the two Marias, x-rays showed that the girls did, in 
        fact, have separate and complete brains, normal in size and structure and 
        separated by a membrane. This meant that the surgeons would not have to cut 
        through any brain tissue. The arteries that carried oxygenated blood to their 
        brains were also separate, but the veins that drained the blood were interwoven 
        and fed into each other&#8217;s circulatory systems. The most complex part of the 
        operation would be to sort out these veins and reroute each girl&#8217;s blood supply. 
        And this is where rapid prototyping played an essential role.</font></P>
      <P align="center"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><IMG border=0 height=487

width=650><br>
        X-rays showed the girls had separate, fully developed brains but 
      also had crisscrossed blood vessels. Tracking those blood vessels on the 
    two-dimensional X-rays, however, was next to impossible.</font></P>
      <P><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The surgical team was headed by Dr. Henry Kawamoto, director of craniofacial 
        surgery at UCLA, and Dr. Jorge Lazareff, director of pediatric neurosurgery at 
        the Mattel Children&#8217;s Hospital. A doctor on the team had used rapid prototypes 
        previously and convinced the lead surgeons that such models might be useful in 
        this case, enabling the plastic surgeons to practice how to separate the two 
        girls&#8217; skulls and plan how they might graft skin to cover their brains once 
        separated. For the neurosurgeons, physical models would help sort out the maze 
        of interconnected blood vessels.</font></P>
      <P><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the team contacted <B>Biomedical Modeling Inc</B>. (BMI) (<A 
href="http://www.biomodel.com">www.biomodel.com</A>) in Boston. 
        According to company founder Eitan Priluck, Biomedical Modeling is one of a 
        handful of companies worldwide whose sole business is fabricating rapid 
        prototypes for medical use. When the UCLA medical team first contacted BMI, 
        Priluck says, there was only about a week left before the scheduled surgery. The 
        UCLA physicians supplied BMI with a series of computed tomography (CT) scans of 
        the two girls. Complicating the task was the fact that the two girls, while 
        connected, couldn&#8217;t be arranged in the CT system so that a single scan of their 
        heads could be made. Instead, three sets of scan data were collected at 
        different angles and BMI had to register and combine them into a single 
        three-dimensional model.</font></P>
      <P><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Priluck says his team used <B>Materialise</B>&#8217;s MIMICS software to combine 
        the scans and process the data. In most cases, he says, doctors want biomodels 
        built of either bone or soft tissue but not the two combined. With MIMICS, he 
        says it&#8217;s relatively simple to set thresholds to capture such distinctions. In 
        this case, however, the surgical team wanted a biomodel of the skull that 
        included the blood vessels, which made the job more challenging. He says it took 
        about three days to process the CT data and create STL files for rapid 
        prototyping.</font></P>
      <P><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the past, says Priluck, BMI has used various rapid prototyping 
        technologies, most often stereolithography, because it delivers crisp models 
        with good definition. But this case presented some challenges that made the use 
        of stereolithography problematic if not impossible. With a stereolithography 
        model, the maze of blood vessels would have required support structures that 
        would have been next to impossible to remove. So Priluck decided to see if a new 
        rapid prototyping technology might be more effective.</font></P>
      <P><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Priluck contacted <B>InterPro </B>(<SPAN class=msoIns><INS 
cite="mailto:L.%20Stephen%20%20Wolfe" dateTime="2002-08-15T08:48"><A 
href="http://www.interpro-rtc.com">www.interpro-rtc.com</A></INS></SPAN>), 
        a nearby rapid prototyping service provider in Deep River, Connecticut. InterPro 
        operates stereolithography and selective laser sintering systems as well as a <B>3D Systems</B> ThermoJet concept modeler. In addition, it recently took 
        delivery of an <B>Objet Tempo</B> rapid prototyping system. The Tempo, made by 
        the Israeli company <B>Objet Geometries</B> <B>Ltd</B>. (<SPAN class=msoIns><INS 
cite="mailto:L.%20Stephen%20%20Wolfe" dateTime="2002-08-15T08:49"><A 
href="http://www.objet.co.il/">www.objet.co.il</A></INS></SPAN>), builds 
        parts by selectively jetting tiny droplets of acrylate photopolymer and then 
        curing the drops, layer by layer, with light. Unlike stereolithography, which 
        uses the primary building material for supports that must be cut or sanded away, 
        the Tempo employs a second photopolymer for supports that never fully harden. 
        Once a part is complete, this gel-like support material can be wiped off or 
        removed by water jet.</font></P>
      <P><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">InterPro co-owner Kevin Dyer agreed that the task seemed well-suited to the 
        abilities of the Tempo and offered to build three parts, one of each girl&#8217;s 
        skull and one of the junction between the two. Dyer says the STL files supplied 
        by BMI were large, about 80 megabytes each, but contained no flaws. He says his 
        team verified the data, determined the optimum orientation of each part in the 
        Tempo&#8217;s build chamber, and started building. He says it took about 24 hours to 
        build each of the three parts.</font></P>
      <P align="center"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><IMG border=0 height=480

width=640><br>
        Biomedical Modeling Inc. and InterPro made models of each girl&#8217;s 
      skull.</font></P>
      <P><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once they were built, Dyer says removing the Objet support material proved a 
        bit more challenging than he had anticipated. Because the blood vessels were so 
        delicate, it was impossible to blast away the support gel with a water jet 
        without also damaging the fragile structure. So Dyer says his team had to spoon 
        out and clean off the support material by hand, at times heating the parts with 
        warm water to further soften the material. He says his technicians had to check 
        the data constantly to make sure they didn&#8217;t remove critical parts of the 
        models. In all, he says, it took about eight hours to clean the parts.</font></P>
      <P align="center"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><IMG border=0 height=385 
src="images/conjoined-twins/02aug-gs7-twins7.jpg" 
width=560><br>
        They also made a model of the region where the two skulls 
    connected so that the surgeons could study the maze of blood vessels.</font></P>
      <P><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Priluck says he shipped the parts to UCLA as soon as he received them from 
        InterPro, and the doctors were delighted with them. Kawamoto&#8217;s plastic-surgery 
        team used strips of felt representing the girls&#8217; skin to plan how they would 
        cover the skulls once the twins were separated. And Lazareff&#8217;s group used the 
        model of the intersection of the two skulls to help plan how it would reroute 
        the necessary blood vessels. The operation took about 22 hours to complete. 
        Similar procedures in the past, says Priluck, have taken as long as 97 hours. 
        Part of this time savings almost certainly was attributable to the rapid 
        prototyping models. Says Kawamoto, &quot;No matter how good our 3D graphics are, 
        there is nothing like holding a model in your hands.&quot; Contact: <B>Biomedical
